## notes

Bare-bones note management - this is my personal note-taking script. Works on MacOS and Linux, the dependencies are mildly non-standard. I use this at work for fast note-taking which is _versioned_ as well as clean.

Path dependencies:
- fd
- vim
- git
- tree

Vim dependencies:
- Goyo
- NERDTree

Editing this to suit your preferences is hopefully pretty self-explanatory!
